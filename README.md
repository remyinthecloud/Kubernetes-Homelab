# Kubernetes Homelab

*My personal homelab where I can break and fix things without suffering real world consequences ;)*

# Hardware
- HP Elitedesk 800 G3 Mini i7-6700, 64GB RAM, 1TB SSD

# Goals
- [ ] Install **Unbuntu** on Elitedesk which will serve as my server
- [ ] Update the system before installing more packages, and service
- [ ] Install **Docker** - I will use this to manage containers for Kubernetes
- [ ] Install **Kubernetes** - I will use K3s to do this since it's lightweight and beginner friendly
- [ ] Install **Kubectl** - this is the kubernetes CLI, to manage and communicate with the kubernetes cluster
- [ ] Kubernetes requires a network plugin to allow communication between containers, I will choose **Calico** for this as I see it as a highly sought after tool for devops and cloud engineer
