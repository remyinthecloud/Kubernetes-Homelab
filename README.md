# Kubernetes Homelab

*My personal homelab where I can break and fix things without suffering real world consequences ;)*

# Hardware
- HP Elitedesk 800 G3 Mini i7-6700, 64GB RAM, 1TB SSD

# Goals
- [x] Install **Unbuntu** on Elitedesk which will serve as my server
- [x] Update the system before installing more packages, and service
- [x] Install **Docker** - Not sure if or how I will use this yet
- [x] Install **Kubernetes** - I will use K3s to do this since it's lightweight and beginner friendly
- [ ] Kubernetes requires a network plugin to allow communication between containers, I will choose **Calico** for this as I see it as a highly sought after tool for devops and cloud engineer
